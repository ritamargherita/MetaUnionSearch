0;DataTransformations: Socioeconomic status was measured using annual income and transformed into a categorical variable; educational attainment was measured as the highest level of education completed and transformed into a categorical variable;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Results: There is a significant relationship between socioeconomic status and educational attainment (p < .05); those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to have higher levels of educational attainment;;;;;;;;;;;;
2;DataQuality: Data was collected through surveys and measures of reliability and validity were conducted; data was cleaned and checked for missing values;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;DataTransformations: Social media usage was measured as hours spent on social media per day and transformed into a continuous variable; self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and transformed into a continuous variable;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;Results: There is a significant negative correlation between social media usage and adolescent self-esteem (r = -.25, p < .05); after controlling for confounding variables, social media usage explains 5% of the variance in adolescent self-esteem;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;DataTransformations: Racial discrimination was measured using the Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaire and transformed into a continuous variable; mental health outcomes were measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and transformed into a continuous variable;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;Results: There is a significant positive correlation between racial discrimination and mental health outcomes (r = .35, p < .05); after controlling for confounding variables, racial discrimination explains 10% of the variance in mental health outcomes;;;;;;;;;;;;
9;DataTransformations: Parental involvement was measured using the Parental Involvement Scale and transformed into a continuous variable; academic achievement was measured using standardized test scores and transformed into a continuous variable;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;Results: There is a significant positive correlation between parental involvement and academic achievement (r = .20, p < .05); after controlling for confounding variables, parental involvement explains 5% of the variance in academic achievement;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;DataQuality: Data was collected through surveys and academic records; measures of reliability and validity were conducted; data was cleaned and checked for missing values;;;;;;;;;;;
12;DataTransformations: Physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and transformed into a categorical variable; cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and transformed into a continuous variable;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;Results: There is a significant relationship between physical activity and cognitive function (p < .05); those who engage in higher levels of physical activity have higher scores on cognitive function measures;;;;;;;;;;;;
15;DataTransformations: Immigration status was measured as a categorical variable (undocumented, legal permanent resident, naturalized citizen); psychological well-being was measured using the Mental Health Inventory and transformed into a continuous variable;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;Results: There is a significant difference in psychological well-being based on immigration status (F(2,497) = 56, p < .05); those who are undocumented have the lowest levels of psychological well-being, followed by legal permanent residents, and naturalized citizens;;;;;;;;;;;;
18;DataTransformations: Social support was measured using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and transformed into a continuous variable; depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and transformed into a continuous variable;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;Results: There is a significant negative correlation between social support and depressive symptoms (r = -.30, p < .05); after controlling for confounding variables, social support explains 8% of the variance in depressive symptoms;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;DataTransformations: Food insecurity was measured using the USDA Household Food Security Survey Module and transformed into a categorical variable (food secure, food insecure); academic outcomes were measured using cumulative GPA and transformed into a continuous variable;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;Results: There is a significant difference in academic outcomes based on food insecurity (t(1008) = 56, p < .05); those who are food insecure have lower cumulative GPAs;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;DataTransformations: Sleep disturbances were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and transformed into a continuous variable; quality of life was measured using the Short Form-36 Health Survey and transformed into a continuous variable;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;Results: There is a significant negative correlation between sleep disturbances and quality of life (r = -.40, p < .05); after controlling for confounding variables, sleep disturbances explain 10% of the variance in quality of life;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;DataTransformations: Exposure to community violence was measured using the Exposure to Community Violence Scale and transformed into a continuous variable; mental health outcomes were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and transformed into a continuous variable;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;Results: There is a significant positive correlation between exposure to community violence and mental health outcomes (r = .30, p < .05); after controlling for confounding variables, exposure to community violence explains 7% of the variance in mental health outcomes;;;;;;;;;;;;
